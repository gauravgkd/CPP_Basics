# Basic C++ Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs that are designed for beginners to learn the fundamentals of C++ programming. These programs cover various basic concepts of C++, such as variables, data types, control structures (if-else, for loop, while loop), functions, arrays, and more.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your computer. The most common compilers are GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for Linux and MinGW for Windows.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (GCC recommended for Linux, MinGW for Windows)
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of terminal or command prompt commands

### Installation

1. **Install a C++ Compiler:**
   - **Linux (GCC):** Usually pre-installed; if not, install by running `sudo apt-get install g++` in the terminal.
   - **Windows (MinGW):** Download and install from [MinGW's official website](http://mingw.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-basic-programs.git
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**
   ```
   cd cpp-basic-programs
   ```

4. **Compile a Program:**
   ```
   g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
   ```
   Replace `program_name` with the name of the program file you want to compile.

5. **Run the Program:**
   ```
   ./program_name
   ```

## Programs Included

This repository includes the following basic C++ programs:

- **Hello World:** The classic starting point for any programming language. (`hello_world.cpp`)
- **Basic Arithmetic:** Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in C++. (`basic_arithmetic.cpp`)
- **If-Else Statements:** Shows how to use conditional statements. (`if_else.cpp`)
- **For Loop:** Examples of using for loops for iteration. (`for_loop.cpp`)
- **While Loop:** Demonstrates the use of while loops. (`while_loop.cpp`)
- **Functions:** How to define and call functions. (`functions.cpp`)
- **Arrays:** Demonstrates the use of arrays. (`arrays.cpp`)
- **... and more**

Feel free to explore and run each program to understand how C++ handles different programming constructs.
